I am a Computer Scientist with experience working on both theoretical and applied artificial intelligence problems, being mainly interested in building intelligent computer systems capable of making decisions under uncertain data and applications where trust is crucial.

I have obtained my P.hD in Computer Science and Computational Mathematics from the University of SÃ£o Paulo at Instituto de CiÃªncias MatemÃ¡ticas e de ComputaÃ§Ã£o - ICMC, conducting studies about fuzzy text mining problems. During my Ph.D., I had two international stages: i) short research stay at Universidad de Granada, supervised by Prof. Dr. Enrique Herrera-Viedma and financed by the Santander/Banespa International Mobility program; and ii) long research stay at McGill University, supervised by Prof. MD Pierre Pluye and financed by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES). Furthermore, from 2019 to 2020, I have conducted my postdoctoral research about fuzzy data streams at ICMC/USP/Brazil, one of the most important Brazilian institutions in Computer Science, Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, and Statistics. 

Specialties: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Fuzzy Systems, Explainable AI.

- ðŸ‘€ I have been passionate about AI, and IÂ´ve been studying, learning, and teaching about this theme since 2006!  I am motivated by the computational ways to discover and simulate knowledge, taking advantage of Machine Learning algorithms.
- ðŸ“« I hold the position of Assistant Professor at the Institute of Computing, Federal University of Bahia (IC-UFBA), supervising Bachelor, MSc, and Ph.D. students.
